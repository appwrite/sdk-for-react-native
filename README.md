**This SDK is compatible with Appwrite server version 1.5.x. For older versions, please check [previous releases](https://github.com/appwrite/sdk-for-react-native/releases).**

Appwrite is an open-source backend as a service server that abstract and simplify complex and repetitive development tasks behind a very simple to use REST API. Appwrite aims to help you develop your apps faster and in a more secure way. Use the React Native SDK to integrate your app with the Appwrite server to easily start interacting with all of Appwrite backend APIs and tools. For full API documentation and tutorials go to [https://appwrite.io/docs](https://appwrite.io/docs)

## Installation

To install

```bash
npx expo install react-native-appwrite react-native-url-polyfill
```



## Getting Started

### Add your Platform
If this is your first time using Appwrite, create an account and create your first project.

Then, under **Add a platform**, add a **Android app** or a **Apple app**. You can skip optional steps.

#### iOS steps
Add your app **name** and **Bundle ID**. You can find your **Bundle Identifier** in the **General** tab for your app's primary target in XCode. For Expo projects you can set or find it on **app.json** file at your project's root directory.

#### Android steps
Add your app's **name** and **package name**, Your package name is generally the **applicationId** in your app-level **build.gradle** file. For Expo projects you can set or find it on **app.json** file at your project's root directory.

## Setup

On `index.js` add import for `react-native-url-polyfill`

```
import 'react-native-url-polyfill/auto'
```

> If you are building for iOS, don't forget to install pods
> `cd ios && pod install && cd ..`

### Init your SDK
Initialize your SDK with your Appwrite server API endpoint and project ID which can be found in your project settings page.

```js
import { Client } from 'react-native-appwrite';
// Init your React Native SDK
const client = new Client();

client
    .setEndpoint('http://localhost/v1') // Your Appwrite Endpoint
    .setProject('455x34dfkj') // Your project ID
    .setPlatform('com.example.myappwriteapp') // Your application ID or bundle ID.
;
```

### Make Your First Request
Once your SDK object is set, access any of the Appwrite services and choose any request to send. Full documentation for any service method you would like to use can be found in your SDK documentation or in the [API References](https://appwrite.io/docs) section.

```js
const account = new Account(client);

// Register User
account.create(ID.unique(), 'me@example.com', 'password', 'Jane Doe')
    .then(function (response) {
        console.log(response);
    }, function (error) {
        console.log(error);
    });

```

### Full Example
```js
import { Client, Account, ID } from 'react-native-appwrite';
// Init your React Native SDK
const client = new Client();

client
    .setEndpoint('http://localhost/v1') // Your Appwrite Endpoint
    .setProject('455x34dfkj')
    .setPlatform('com.example.myappwriteapp') // YOUR application ID
;

const account = new Account(client);

// Register User
account.create(ID.unique(), 'me@example.com', 'password', 'Jane Doe')
    .then(function (response) {
        console.log(response);
    }, function (error) {
        console.log(error);
    });
